<h3>Why Spring Framework not Node.js</h3>
<p>Spring Framework is written in Java. Java is more statically-typed (type-save), many easily usable dependencies and support for multi-threading. Node.js doesn't support multi-threading and it might have computational bottlenecks.In this project, number of cases increasing everyday so there is a growing data. Thats why Spring Framework is used in this project.</p>
